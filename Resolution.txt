Exo Dog:

The first two years of a dogâ€™s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to convert your human age into dog years.
let myAge = 24; //declaring and initializing age
let earlyYears = 2;//initializing earlyYears
let laterYears, myAgeInDogYears;
let myName = 'YANSANE'.toLowerCase();
earlyYears *= 10.5;
// for the two years accounted we substracted 2 from our age
myAge-=2;
// we affected a new value of myAge to lateYears
laterYears= myAge;
//assigning a new value to lateYears
laterYears*=4;
myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
